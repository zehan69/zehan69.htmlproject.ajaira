                      Hello there ,My name is Zehan and I am a conqurer.I have unlocked my sharingan when I was 15.I've mastered genjutsu.Conquered grand-line.<br><br>
                      To cast a genjutsu of this scale, the user's Rinne Sharingan must be reflected
                      off of the moon.The exact method of achieving this varies from user to user:<br>
                      in the anime Kaguya Ōtsutsuki uses Yomotsu Hirasaka to create a portal to a dimension containing a moon; Obito Uchiha produces
                      the Ten-Tails and transforms it into a construct of the God Tree,
                      hich has a Rinne Sharingan within the blooming flower at its top; Madara Uchiha, per his Eye of the Moon Plan, flies into the
                      sky and reflects his own Rinne Sharingan off of the moon.<br><br>
                      You may be thinking why I didn't kill the wifi brat? It's because he ain't worth it.<br><br>
                      The Uchiha are descendants of Indra Ōtsutsuki, the elder son of Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki. Through Indra, the Uchiha inherited Hagoromo's "eyes",
                      granting them powerful spiritual energy and chakra. As part of the so-called "Curse of Hatred" first displayed by Indra, Uchiha are subject to powerful emotions:<br>
                      these emotions typically start as love for a friend or family member that then become overpowering hatred when the object of their love is lost.
                      This loss, whether actually experienced or merely threatened, awakens an Uchiha's Sharingan. It is due to the Sharingan that the Uchiha have received much of their
                      fame and notoriety.<br><br>
                      The Uchiha have been fighting the Senju clan for centuries, a rivalry that traces back to the days of Indra and his younger brother, Asura.
                      When the Sage of Six Paths was dying, he selected Asura as his successor, believing Asura's desire for peace through love was better than Indra's peace through power.
                      Indra, driven by his Curse of Hatred, fought Asura to claim what he believed was his birthright. The Uchiha and Senju, descendants of Indra and Asura respectively,
                      continued their battle through the centuries, though none still remembered this reason for their conflict.

                        <b> Haoshoku Haki </b>is a rare form of Haki that allows the user to exert their own willpower over others.
                         This type of Haki cannot be attained through training; it is a power that one must be born with. Only one in
                         several million people are born with this ability.<br>
                         It is said that whoever possesses this type of Haki has the qualities of a king.
                         Haoshoku Haki is considered an extremely dangerous threat and a highly valuable asset by powerful groups such as the Marine Admirals and the Yonko.

                      <font size="4" face="san-serif">
                        The initial concept of Akatsuki was devised by Black Zetsu as part of its plan to revive its mother, though it pretended the idea came from Madara Uchiha.
                         Akatsuki was originally founded by Yahiko during the Third Shinobi World War alongside his childhood friends, Nagato and Konan. As citizens of Amegakure
                        who had been orphaned by the Second Shinobi World War, the three created Akatsuki as a way to bring peace to their home country, which too often got caught
                        in the crossfire of the Five Great Shinobi Countries' many conflicts.[2] In time, the three were approached by Tobi, who introduced himself as Madara Uchiha.
                        [3] Tobi claimed Nagato was the reincarnation of the Sage of Six Paths and offered to teach him to control the power of his Rinnegan, though Yahiko distrusted
                         him and prompted Nagato to turn down his offer.[4] Nevertheless, Tobi would later claim that it was he who encouraged Yahiko to form Akatsuki, unbeknownst to
                         Konan.<br><br>
                        Akatsuki's desire for an end to war attracted many fellow Ame ninja to their cause and, in time, word of their exploits began to travel beyond Amegakure's
                        borders. Akatsuki's early fame was owed largely to Yahiko's leadership and his natural charisma, which kept the group united and motivated them to persevere
                        despite the difficulties of their goal. Yahiko, however, viewed himself as merely a facilitator for Nagato, who would ultimately be the actual source of world
                        peace because of his Rinnegan. Ame's leader, Hanzō, also became aware of Akatsuki and perceived them as a threat to his rule, a belief encouraged by Danzō Shimura
                         in the anime. Hanzō approached Akatsuki offering to help them broker peace between Konohagakure, Iwagakure, and Sunagakure. When Yahiko, Nagato, and Konan arrived
                         to meet with him, however, they were ambushed by Hanzō's men and members of Danzō's Root, who took Konan hostage and forced Yahiko to commit suicide in order to save her.
                          Enraged by Yahiko's death, Nagato summoned the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path and used it to slaughter their attackers, though Hanzō himself escaped.<br><br>
                          In the anime, the other members of Akatsuki were tipped off to Hanzō's plan and attempted to provide backup to Yahiko and the others. Tobi and Zetsu
                          intercepted them and after a long battle, Tobi killed the remaining members of the group.

                        Twenty years before the present, the Bakufu was resistant to the arrival of the Amanto, but they were confronted with the Amanto's superior technology and weapons.
                        When the 12th Shogun collapsed due to anxiety, Tokugawa Sada Sada took the position of Shogun and welcomed the Amanto to their country.<br><br>
                        Some samurai within the country were against this and lost faith in the Bakufu, calling them traitors. This caused a long civil war called the Joui Wars which
                        lasted for about 10 years. <br><br>
                        Those who participated in the Joui War were known as the Old Joui Patriots.Zehan was one of them.

                      What was thought would be a warning to all and extinguish the hopes of all pirates had failed. The last words of Zehan ignited the excitement
                      of the world, and thus began "The Great Age of Pirates", dubbed by a few as the "Age of Dreams". In the 24 years since his death, pirates from all
                      over the world have attempted to find Laugh Tale and the One Piece to claim Zehan's title.<br><br>

                      All the men and women who had contact with Zehan were ordered to be executed.[58] In addition, the World Government issued an order to gather
                      infants and quite possibly commit mass infanticide in order to purge any possible trace of Zehan's progeny. The only ones to survive were his
                      lover Rouge, and his crewmates who went their separate ways after his death. Zehan's blood survived his death through his son Ace.<br><br>

                      As far as directly influencing major contenders, those known to be present at his execution include his apprentices Shanks and Buggy;
                      the Shichibukai Crocodile, Donquixote Doflamingo, Dracule Mihawk, and Gecko Moria; and the revolutionary Monkey D. Dragon, and it
                      can be assumed from their conversation with Shiki that Monkey D. Garp and former Fleet Admiral Sengoku attended as well. Smoker also
                      appeared to be there as a child. When Shiki heard about Zehan's execution, he was deeply angered and attacked Marine Headquarters in retaliation;
                      after a great battle, he was eventually defeated and imprisoned in Impel Down, though would later go on to escape.<br><br>

                      Twenty-two years after his execution, as Whitebeard was about to die, he confirmed to the world that the One Piece is indeed real
                      and inferred the consequences of what would happen once it was discovered.[61] This triggered the beginning of the New Age of Pirates
                      to be created out of Zehan's legendary treasure.<br>
